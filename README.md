# expense-tracker
The Expense Tracker project is a JavaScript-based application designed to help users manage their financial transactions by tracking incomes and expenses. The application allows users to add transactions, categorize them, and view a summary of their financial activity. It provides a user-friendly interface and stores data locally in the browser using Local Storage, ensuring the application is lightweight and accessible without needing a backend.

Expense/Income Entry: Users can input both expenses and incomes, specifying the amount, date, and description (e.g., "Grocery Shopping," "Salary").

Categorization: Users can categorize transactions (e.g., Food, Utilities, Salary, Entertainment) for better tracking and insights into spending patterns.

Editable/Deletable Entries: Transactions can be edited or deleted if needed, ensuring the tracker remains accurate.

Use Cases:
Personal Finance Management: Individuals can use the app to track daily, weekly, or monthly expenses and incomes to manage their personal budget.
Small Business: Entrepreneurs can use it to keep track of their business-related expenses and incomes, helping with budgeting and cash flow management.
Student Use: Students can use the app to track their spending on essentials like food, travel, and entertainment.
